# LCD Keypad Shield
### Arduino

##### Argochamber interactive 2016

This library has implemented the library
```C++
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>
```

Use it as a _wrapper_ for the shield, the keypad shield pins are the **same every time**, so it's a waste of time to use the `<LiquidCrystal.h>` spare.
